Quick start (first 5 minutes)
1. Open this folder in VS Code (File → Open Folder) or run `code .` from the project root.
2. Open the integrated terminal (View → Terminal).
3. Run `git --version` to confirm Git is installed.
4. Start Module 01: `modules/01-digital-literacy.md` — follow the step-by-step exercises.

What you'll build
- "What We Wish We Knew": a short educational website with 8–10 student-written articles, an interactive timeline, and a deployed static site.

What you need
- A laptop or desktop (Windows with WSL2 or macOS recommended)
- Internet access and VS Code (recommended)
- Basic curiosity — no prior programming required

Modules (10 short exercises, ~30–60 min each)

---**Outcome**: Empty portfolio project with documentation and version control**Professional Practices**: Learn industry standards from day one  ---- **Absolute beginners** to web development



## 📚 The 10-Module Learning Journey### **Module 1: Digital Literacy & Environment Setup** (1 hour)



*Each module introduces ONE new concept while practicing ALL previous skills*  **For students who only know phones:** What are files? Folders? How do you actually create something?  **But here's the thing:** Operating a bulldozer requires more engineering knowledge than swinging a pick. The operator needs to understand soil mechanics, safety protocols, precision control, and complex workflows.- Unix commands work natively

**New Skills**: Terminal basics, file system navigation, Markdown fundamentals  

**Content Creation**: Write your first substantial piece - "Why I'm Learning Web Development"  

**AI Skills**: Basic prompting for research and writing assistance  

**Git Foundation**: Understand what version control is and why creators need it  **Same with AI development tools.** GitHub Copilot can write code faster than any human, but you need to understand:**Concepts + AI Implementation**: Understand the WHY, use AI for the HOW  **Practical Application**: Every skill is learned in the context of real project work  

**Outcome**: Professional development environment + your first real content creation experience

- **What to build** (concepts and history)

### **Module 2: Git Fundamentals & Project Foundation** (1 hour)

**New Skills**: Git basics (`init`, `add`, `commit`, `status`)  - **How to direct the AI** (engineering thinking and effective prompting)### **Why This Standardization Matters**

**Content Creation**: "What Is Git and Why Should High Schoolers Care?" - explain version control to peers  

**AI Skills**: Using AI to research technical concepts and improve explanations  - **How to work safely** (Git workflow and version control)

**Web Skills**: Introduction to how Markdown becomes web content  

**Git Mastery**: Basic workflow becomes muscle memory  - **How to collaborate** (professional practices and communication)- **One way to do things** - no platform confusion**Git Every Step**: Version control becomes second nature  

**Outcome**: Project foundation with version control and your first technical explanation

- **How to create content** (research, writing, and teaching)

### **Modules 3-10**: Continue building both content and technical skills...

*[Full module descriptions available in course materials]*- **Professional tools** - what real developers use



---**Your mission:** Build a website called **"What We Wish We Knew: A High Schooler's Guide to Internet & Development Technology History"** while learning to think like a professional technology producer and content creator.



## 🧠 Learning Philosophy: Creation-Centered Education- **Transferable skills** - works everywhere**Real Impact**: Create something genuinely useful for other learners  **Muscle Memory**: Constant practice makes essential skills automatic  



### **Why This Approach Actually Works**---



**🔄 Spiral Learning**: Core concepts are revisited and deepened in each module  - **AI compatibility** - GitHub Copilot works best in proper dev environments

**📱 Phone-Native Friendly**: Starts with appropriate assumptions for mobile-first generation  

**🤖 AI-Enhanced**: Modern tools for efficient implementation, but understanding comes first  ## 🐧 Your Professional Environment

**📚 Story-Driven**: Technology history makes abstract concepts memorable  

**👥 Teaching-Focused**: Learning by teaching creates deepest understanding  **Progressive Complexity**: Each module adds new skills while reinforcing previous ones  

**✍️ Creation-Centered**: Every module requires substantial, meaningful content creation  

**Everyone uses the same setup:** Unix/Linux environment with terminal commands.

### **Breaking the Consumer Conditioning**

- **Start with substance**: No more filling in blanks - you're creating from scratch**From here on, everyone types the same commands, uses the same file system, follows the same workflows.**

- **Embrace difficulty**: Complex topics require deep thinking, not quick answers

- **Value process**: How you create matters as much as what you create

- **Own your learning**: You're responsible for understanding, not just completing assignments

- **Create for others**: Your content helps real people, creating real value- Install WSL2 with Ubuntu



---- Use Ubuntu terminal for everything



## 🎓 Prerequisites & Honest Expectations- Same commands as Mac students---



### ✅ **What You Need**

- Computer (Windows 10/11 or Mac)

- Internet connection

- **Willingness to write substantial content** (not just code)

- **Comfort with not knowing things** (you'll learn by creating)- Use built-in Terminal app

- **Patience with the learning process** (creation takes time)

- 10 hours total commitment (1 hour per module)- Unix commands work natively## 🌳 Git: Your Professional Workflow Foundation

- **Genuine curiosity** about how technology actually works



### ❌ **What You DON'T Need**

- Any programming experience

- Technical background or "computer skills"

- Perfect writing ability (you'll improve by practicing)### **Why This Standardization Matters**---## 🧭 Why This Guide Is Different> This guide follows proven educational principles with hands-on assignments, progressive complexity, and professional mindset development.## 🎯 Who This Guide Is For

- Fear of "being wrong" (iteration and improvement are part of the process)

- Expensive software (everything is free and professional-grade)- **One way to do things** - no platform confusion

- **Professional tools** - what real developers use**Git is not just a tool - it's how professionals think about work.**



### 🚨 **Reality Check: This Will Be Different**- **Transferable skills** - works everywhere

- **You'll write more than you ever have** - substantial, meaningful content

- **You'll think harder than school usually requires** - no multiple choice here- **AI compatibility** - GitHub Copilot works best in proper dev environments## 📚 The 10-Module Journey

- **You'll create things that didn't exist before** - original content and code

- **You'll use AI as a tool, not a crutch** - understanding is still required- **Content creation** - Markdown, Git, and web tools work seamlessly

- **You'll help other students learn** - your content has real impact

### **The Fundamental Professional Workflow**

---

**From here on, everyone types the same commands, uses the same file system, follows the same workflows.**

## 🌟 What You'll Actually Achieve

```
