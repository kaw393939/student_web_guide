*From Technology Consumer to Technology Producer*

*From Technology Consumer to Technology Producer*

> **üì± For 18-year-olds who've only used phones and Google Docs**  

> Transform from passionate technology user to skilled technology creator by building a website that teaches the history of internet and development technology to other high schoolers.*From Technology Consumer to Technology Producer*



---> **üì± For 18-year-olds who've only used phones and Google Docs**  



## üåü Your Next Chapter: From User to Creator> Transform from passive technology consumer to active technology producer by building a website that teaches the history of internet and development technology to other high schoolers.*From Technology Consumer to Technology Producer*



**You're perfectly prepared for this journey.** You already understand technology as a user - now you're ready to understand it as a creator.



### **What You Already Know (And Why It's Valuable)**---> **üì± For 18-year-olds who've only used phones and Google Docs**  

- ‚úÖ **How apps should feel** - You know when something works well or feels confusing

- ‚úÖ **What content engages you** - You understand what makes information interesting or boring  

- ‚úÖ **Mobile-first thinking** - You naturally think about how things work on phones

- ‚úÖ **Quick learning** - You've mastered complex apps and platforms intuitively## üí• The Creation Crisis: Why You've Never Actually Made Anything> Transform from passive technology consumer to active technology producer by building a website that teaches the history of internet and development technology to other high schoolers.*Learn by teaching: Build a "History of Internet & Development Technology" website for high schoolers*

- ‚úÖ **Social connection** - You understand how people share and communicate online



### **What's Different About This Learning Experience**

- **Creation over consumption** - Instead of just using apps, you'll build web experiences**Hard truth:** Your generation has been systematically trained to consume, not create.

- **Open-ended exploration** - No single "right" answer, just better and more creative solutions

- **Substantial writing** - Moving beyond quick messages to explaining complex ideas clearly

- **Understanding over memorization** - Learning how things work, not just how to use them

- **Teaching others** - Creating content that genuinely helps your peers learn### **What Your Education Actually Taught You**---> **üöÄ For 18-year-olds who've only used phones and Google Docs**  



### **Here's What Makes This Exciting**- ‚úÖ **Consume content** (scroll, watch, click)

**You're going to learn the complete content creation and web production pipeline that professional developers use every day.** And because you already understand the user experience side, you'll have insights that many technical people miss.

- ‚úÖ **Fill in blanks** (multiple choice, worksheets)

- ‚úÖ **Follow instructions** (step-by-step tutorials)

## üõ†Ô∏è From User Mindset to Creator Mindset

- ‚ùå **Create original content** from scratch## üí• The Creation Crisis: Why You've Never Actually Made Anything> Transform from passive technology consumer to active technology producer by building a website that teaches the history of internet and development technology to other high schoolers.*A spiral learning approach for absolute beginners*

### **User Mindset (Your Current Strength)**

- "I know when apps work well or feel broken"- ‚ùå **Solve open-ended problems** with no "right" answer

- "I can learn new interfaces quickly"

- "I understand what makes content engaging"- ‚ùå **Build something** that didn't exist before

- "I know how people actually use technology"

- **"I consume content and know what I like"**

- **"I communicate in short, effective messages"**

- **"I learn by exploring and trying things"**### **The Brutal Reality Check****Hard truth:** Your generation has been systematically trained to consume, not create.



### **Creator Mindset (Where You're Going)**- You've probably never written anything longer than a text message

- "I can design experiences that work well for users"

- "I can build interfaces that are intuitive to learn"- You think "making things" is for "creative people" or "technical people"  

- "I can create content that engages and educates"

- "I can understand how technology works under the hood"- You expect everything to work automatically without understanding how

- **"I create valuable content that helps others learn"**

- **"I write clear explanations that make complex ideas accessible"**- You've been trained to be a perfect consumer in a system designed to keep you consuming
- ### **What Your Education Actually Taught You**---> **üåü For absolute beginners with zero programming experience**  

- **"I learn by building and teaching"**



### **Your Unique Advantage**

Most people learning web development either know technology OR know users - but not both. You already understand the user side deeply, so when you learn the technical side, you'll be able to create things that actually work well for real people.### **But Here's the Revolutionary Opportunity**- ‚úÖ **Consume content** (scroll, watch, click)



---**You're about to learn the complete content creation and web production pipeline that professional developers use every day.**



## üìù The Complete Content Creation Pipeline- ‚úÖ **Fill in blanks** (multiple choice, worksheets)



**You'll master the full professional workflow:**---

### **2. ‚úçÔ∏è Write ‚Üí Markdown Content Creation**

- **Markdown** = "Advanced text messaging" for the web### **Consumer Mindset (Your Current Reality)**

- Write content in plain text with simple formatting

- Focus on ideas and structure, not visual design (yet)- "If something breaks, restart the app"- ‚ùå **Solve open-ended problems** with no "right" answer

- Learn to explain complex concepts in simple language

- "Just try random stuff until it works"

### **3. ü§ñ Prompt ‚Üí AI-Assisted Enhancement**

# Student Web Developer Guide ‚Äî Course Intro

Welcome. This short README is the course introduction. Modules contain step-by-step exercises; start with Module 01 and proceed in order.

Course goal: learn a practical web development workflow while creating a student-written educational website. Skills: Unix shell, Git (professional workflow), Markdown, HTML/CSS/JS, and using AI tools responsibly.

Quick links
- Module 01 ‚Äî Digital Literacy & First Content Creation: `modules/01-digital-literacy.md`
- Module 02 ‚Äî Terminal Basics: `modules/02-terminal-basics.md`
- Module 03 ‚Äî Markdown & VS Code: `modules/03-markdown-vscode.md`

Getting started (teacher-assisted)
1. Open this project folder in VS Code.
2. Open the terminal in VS Code (View ‚Üí Terminal).
3. Run `git --version` and confirm output.
4. Start Module 01.

Student expectations (short)
- Complete short, guided exercises and submit the small deliverables listed in each module.
- Make small, atomic commits with clear messages.
- Ask for help early‚Äîuse Copilot for drafts, and your teacher or classmates for review.

Help & troubleshooting
- If your Git or terminal setup fails, ask a teacher to assist. We expect some setup issues and will help during class time.
- Avoid destructive commands (e.g., `git reset --hard`) until you understand recovery steps‚Äîthey will be taught in later modules.

Next: open `modules/01-digital-literacy.md` and begin.
