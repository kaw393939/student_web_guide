### Module 05 — Team GitFlow: Forks, Conflicts, Integration (90–120 min)

Goal: form teams, fork the template/canonical repo, integrate 2–3 shortlisted pieces, resolve conflicts, and open PRs to the teacher repo.

Outputs (toward ~20 total)
- Per team: 3–4 polished articles (2 imported + 1–2 team-written) with images where helpful.
- Per team: `images/team-<n>/` with `prompts.md` and credits captured in front-matter.
- Optional: start drafting index entries for each article to later merge into `index.md` (see `templates/index.md`).

Steps
1) Form teams of 3–4; fork the teacher repo; clone the fork.
2) Create `group/<team-number>/integration` branch.
3) Import 2 shortlisted drafts into `articles/` and assign roles: Author, Editor, Reviewer, Integrator.
4) Write 1 new team article; add images; save prompts and credits.
5) Resolve any merge conflicts and push branches.
6) Open PRs from fork → teacher repo; include short release notes explaining editorial choices.

Acceptance criteria
- 3–4 quality articles per team merged into the team fork; PRs opened to teacher repo.
- Conflicts handled correctly; reviewers sign off.
- Each article has a one-line summary usable in the site index.
