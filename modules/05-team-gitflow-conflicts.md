### Module 05 — Team GitFlow: Forks, Conflicts, Integration (90–120 min)

Goal: form teams, fork the template/canonical repo, integrate 2–3 shortlisted pieces, resolve conflicts, and open PRs to the teacher repo.

At a glance
- Deliverables (per team): 3–4 polished articles + `images/team-<n>/prompts.md`
- Skills: forks, team integration, conflict resolution, cross-team review

Outputs (toward ~20 total)
- Per team: 3–4 polished articles (2 imported + 1–2 team-written) with images where helpful.
- Per team: `images/team-<n>/` with `prompts.md` and credits captured in front-matter.
- Optional: start drafting index entries for each article to later merge into `index.md` (see `templates/index.md`).

Steps
1) Form teams of 3–4; fork the teacher repo; clone the fork (20–30 min).
2) Create `group/<team-number>/integration` branch (team integration base) (5 min).
3) Import 2 shortlisted drafts into `articles/` and assign roles: Author, Editor, Reviewer, Integrator (15–20 min).
4) Write 1 new team article; add images; save prompts and credits (30–45 min).
5) Resolve any merge conflicts and push branches (15–25 min).
6) Open PRs from fork → teacher repo; include short release notes explaining editorial choices; request at least 1 peer reviewer from another team plus instructor (10–15 min).
