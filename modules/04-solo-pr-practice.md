### Module 04 — Solo PR Practice: Remote, Push, Review (30–45 min)

Goal: connect to a remote, push a feature branch, and complete a full solo PR cycle.

Outputs (counts toward ~20 total)
- 1 individual article: `articles/m04-cloud-<lastname>.md` on cloud hosting & business impact. Optional AI image with credit/alt text.

Steps
1) Ensure remote is set and `main` exists:
   - `git remote -v`
   - `git branch -M main`
2) Create `feature/<lastname>-m04-cloud`; write article using template; include 2–3 links.
3) Push branch and open a PR. Add a self-review checklist in the PR description (use `PR_CHECKLIST.md`).
4) Request one peer review; update article once.

Acceptance criteria
- Branch + PR complete; one revision commit.
- Article meets length/quality and includes sources; image (if used) has credit + alt text.
