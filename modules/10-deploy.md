### Module 10 — Quick Deploy: Markdown to Site (30–60 minutes)

Goal: convert Markdown to a simple static site and deploy via GitHub Pages.

Estimated time: 30–60 minutes

Tasks

1) Create `index.md` landing page

```markdown
# What We Wish We Knew

Start here. Link to modules and student articles.
```

2) Use GitHub Pages (recommended classroom method)

- On GitHub: Repository → Settings → Pages → Branch: `main` (or `gh-pages`) → Save.
- GitHub will publish the site at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>` within minutes.

3) Optional: use a static site generator later (MkDocs, Jekyll)

Deliverable: site URL or note that Pages is configured.

Teacher notes
- For class privacy, use repository settings to make the repo private or use a teacher-hosted org.
