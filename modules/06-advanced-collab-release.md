### Module 06 â€” Advanced Collaboration: Issues, Releases, Deploy (2+ sessions)

Goal: use issues for planning, final integration via PRs, create an index, and deploy with GitHub Pages; close with a short team report.

Outputs (finalize ~20)
- Canonical repo: ~20 articles total merged + `index.md` built from `templates/index.md`.
- Each team: a 1-page report `reports/team-<n>-report.md`.

Steps
1) Issues & planning: create GitHub issues for remaining tasks; assign owners and due dates.
2) Final integration: PRs into the canonical repo; teacher merges selected articles using squash merges.
3) Build index: consolidate titles, authors, one-line summaries; generate `index.md` from `templates/index.md`.
4) QA: run a quick link pass; verify image credits and alt text in front-matter.
5) Deploy with GitHub Pages (branch or folder per teacher choice) and test links.
6) Presentations and team reports; optional: tag a release (e.g., `v1.0-class-YYYYMMDD`).

Acceptance criteria
- ~20 articles merged; index complete; site deployed and accessible.
- Reports include roles, lessons, and business/tech takeaways; images have credits; links validated.
