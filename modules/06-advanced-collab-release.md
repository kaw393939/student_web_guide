### Module 06 — Advanced Collaboration: Issues, Releases, Deploy (2+ sessions)

Goal: use issues for planning, final integration via PRs, create an index, and deploy with GitHub Pages; close with a short team report.

At a glance
- Deliverables: integrated site (~20 pages), `index.md`, team reports
- Skills: issues, final PRs, QA, deployment, optional release tag

Outputs (finalize ~20)
- Canonical repo: ~20 articles total merged + `index.md` built from `templates/index.md`.
- Each team: a 1-page report `reports/team-<n>-report.md`.

Steps
1) Issues & planning (15–25 min): create GitHub issues for remaining tasks; assign owners and due dates. Ensure `main` is protected and PR reviews are required.
2) Final integration (30–60 min): PRs into the canonical repo; teacher merges selected articles using squash merges.
3) Build index (20–30 min): consolidate titles, authors, one-line summaries; generate `index.md` from `templates/index.md`.
4) QA (10–15 min): run a quick link pass; verify image credits and alt text in front-matter; ensure titles/summaries match `index.md` entries.
5) Deploy with GitHub Pages (10–15 min) (branch or folder per teacher choice) and test links.
6) Presentations and team reports; optional: tag a release (e.g., `v1.0-class-YYYYMMDD`).

Acceptance criteria
- ~20 articles merged; index complete; site deployed and accessible.
- Reports include roles, lessons, and business/tech takeaways; images have credits; links validated; `main` remains protected.

Success criteria (scan)
- Index contains titles, authors, and one-line summaries for all pages
- All images have alt text and credits; links pass a quick check
- Pages deployed and accessible; release optionally tagged
