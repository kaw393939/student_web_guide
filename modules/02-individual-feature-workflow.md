### Module 02 — Individual Feature Workflow (30–45 min)

Goal: practice a clean feature-branch → PR loop and write a short article on browsers/standards or similar topic.

Outputs (counts toward ~20 total)
- 1 individual article: `articles/m02-<topic>-<lastname>.md` (e.g., browsers, HTML/CSS history, mobile OS)
- Optional: 1 AI image `images/student-<lastname>/m02-<topic>-v1.jpg` (+ record prompt in `images/student-<lastname>/prompts.md`)

Steps
1) Create a branch `feature/<lastname>-m02-<topic>` (5 min).
2) Use `templates/article.md` and save to `articles/m02-<topic>-<lastname>.md` (300–400 words) (20–25 min).
3) Push branch and open a PR titled `[Review] m02: <short-title> — <lastname>` (5 min).
4) Peer review: comment 3 concrete suggestions on a classmate’s PR; incorporate one suggestion into your article (10–15 min).

Acceptance criteria
- Front-matter complete; links verified; image credit + alt text if image used.
- Branch + PR created; at least one revision commit after peer feedback.
