# {{ title }}

2. Why it mattered technically (short explanation).
3. Who benefited / what the business implications were.
4. What this means for creators in 2025 (practical takeaway).

Sources: include 2 links under a **Sources** heading.

Notes

- `image`, `image_alt`, and `image_credit` are optional for individual drafts but required when an image is included.
