# How Microsoft Shaped the Personal Computer Era

In April 1975, childhood friends Bill Gates and Paul Allen officially founded Microsoft after creating a version of the BASIC programming language for the Altair 8800, one of the first personal microcomputers. The name *Micro-soft* combined “microcomputer” and “software,” signaling their focus at a time when hardware dominated the industry.  

The turning point came in 1980 when IBM chose Microsoft to provide the operating system for its new personal computer. Microsoft licensed and adapted an existing OS (QDOS), which became MS-DOS. This deal set the stage for Microsoft’s rapid rise, as MS-DOS became the standard across IBM-compatible PCs.  

In 1985, Microsoft introduced Windows, a graphical extension for MS-DOS that made personal computing more accessible. Through the 1990s, Windows and the Microsoft Office suite became near-universal tools, shaping the way businesses and individuals used computers. Microsoft’s dominance in the desktop era influenced everything from global productivity to antitrust debates.

### Why It Mattered Technically
Microsoft’s success was built on providing software that could run on many different hardware systems, unlike Apple’s tightly controlled ecosystem. By focusing on licensing rather than selling its own machines, Microsoft created a flexible, scalable model that pushed the personal computer into the mainstream.

### Business Implications
Microsoft demonstrated the power of software as a business model. Instead of making money from hardware sales, the company earned recurring revenue through licensing agreements. This approach not only drove massive profits but also redefined how value was captured in the computing industry.

### Practical Takeaway for Creators in 2025
Think about leverage. Microsoft succeeded by creating a product (MS-DOS, then Windows) that scaled far beyond its own distribution channels. In today’s world, building scalable platforms and ecosystems—rather than isolated products—remains one of the strongest ways to grow and endure.
